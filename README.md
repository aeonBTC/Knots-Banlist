### Knots node list updated June 22, 2025

If you would like to apply this banlist to your node:
1. Stop your Bitcoin node.
2. Navigate to your main Bitcoin directory (where your bitcoin.conf file is).
3. Save and copy the "banlist.json" file from this repository to your Bitcoin directory.
4. Start your Bitcoin node.

<i></y></u><b>Why would I want to ban Knots nodes?</b></i>
<br>
Knots nodes attempt to encumber valid bitcoin transactions from propagating the Bitcoin network. This means that if your node is connected to a majority of knots nodes it will hinder your nodes ability to estimate fees properly as well as increase the time it takes to recieve new blocks. Both of which prevent your node from running optimally.
