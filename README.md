### Knots node list updated June 22, 2025

If you would like to apply this banlist to your node:
1. Stop your Bitcoin node.
2. Navigate to your main Bitcoin directory (where your bitcoin.conf file is).
3. Copy banlist.json from this repository to your Bitcoin directory.
4. Start your Bitcoin node.

<i>Why would I want to ban Knots nodes?</i>
Knots nodes attempt to encumber valid bitcoin transactions from propagating the Bitocin network. This means that if your node is peered with a majority of knots nodes it will hinder your nodes ability to estimate fees properly as well as increase latency for block proagation. Both of which prevent your node from running efficiently.
