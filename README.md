### Knots node list updated June 22, 2025

If you would like to apply this banlist to your node:
1. Stop your Bitcoin node.
2. Navigate to your main Bitcoin directory (where your bitcoin.conf file is).
3. Save and copy the "banlist.json" file from this repository to your Bitcoin directory.
4. Start your Bitcoin node.

<i>Note: Using this banlist will override any existing banlist.json. If you already has entries in your banlist.json you want to preserve, simply add them to this new banlist.json.</i>

<i></y></u><b>Why would I want to ban Knots nodes?</b></i>
<br>
By default, Knots nodes implement a highly restrictive relay policy that attempts to prevent certain valid bitcoin transactions from propagating through the Bitcoin network. This means that if your node is connected to a majority of Knots nodes, it will hinder your nodeâ€™s ability to estimate fees properly and increase the time it takes for your node to receive new blocks

I2P nodes are added manually. Feel free to submit a PR for any missing nodes.
