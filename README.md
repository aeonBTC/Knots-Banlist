### Knots node list updated June 22, 2025

If you would like to apply this banlist to your node:
1. Stop your Bitcoin node.
2. Navigate to your main Bitcoin directory (where your bitcoin.conf file is).
3. Save and copy the "banlist.json" file from this repository to your Bitcoin directory.
4. Start your Bitcoin node.

<i></y></u><b>Why would I want to ban Knots nodes?</b></i>
<br>
By default Knots nodes running a highly restrict relay policy that attempts to encumber certain valid bitcoin transactions from propagating the Bitcoin network. This means that if your node is connected to a majority of knots nodes it will hinder your nodes ability to estimate fees properly as well as increase the time it takes your node to recieve new blocks.

Knots node list was sourced from: https://bitnodes.io/api/v1/snapshots/latest/

I2P Knots nodes are added manually, feel free to submit a PR if I am missing any.
